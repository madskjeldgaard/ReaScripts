# MK ReaScripts

This repo contains a collection of my [ReaScripts](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascript.php). 

The scripts here are developed mostly as helpful tools for my (electroacoustic / electronic) [ composition process ](http://madskjeldgaard.dk) in Reaper, harnessing Reaper's powerful potential for sonic weirdness.

All my scripts are prefixed "mk_"

## Installation
In REAPER, go to:

OPTIONS->Show Reaper resource path

Note this path. 

Then in terminal, move to it and find the Scripts sub folder. For example:

`cd $HOME/.config/REAPER/Scripts`

Then download this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/mk_scripts`
