# MK ReaScripts

Hello

This repo contains a collection of my [ReaScripts](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascript.php). 

The scripts here are developed mostly as helpful tools for my (electroacoustic / electronic) [ composition process ](http://madskjeldgaard.dk) in Reaper, harnessing Reaper's powerful potential for sonic weirdness.

All my scripts are prefixed "mk_"
